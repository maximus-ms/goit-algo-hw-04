# GoITNeo Algo HW-3

## Task:
Compare three sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and Timsort based on their execution time. The analysis should be supported by empirical data obtained through testing the algorithms on different datasets. Empirically verify the theoretical complexity estimates of the algorithms, such as sorting on large arrays. Use the timeit module to measure the execution time of the algorithms.
